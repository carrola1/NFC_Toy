- Fix mirrored pinout of SWD connector
- Change footprint of SWD connector to 0.05"
- I2C data and clock test point silk screen labels are swapped
- Consider increasing size of mounting holes
- GAIN_SLOT and AUDIO_SD_N signals are swapped on the audio amplifier
- May be good to increase mounting hole diameter
- Could probably decrease size of regulator inductor
- Rethink sleep mode power
    * Use Wake pin on microcontroller 
    * Consider turning off regulators and running micro straight from battery
    * DotStars apparently consume about 1 mA even when off.
    * uC and accelerometer could both run directly from battery
